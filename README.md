# FitHire AI Workflow:

## Data Ingestion:

*Collect resumes (PDF/DOCX) and job descriptions from public datasets.*

## Preprocessing:

*Parse and clean text (NLP, tokenization, removing stopwords).*

## Feature Extraction:

*Convert texts to embeddings (TF-IDF, BERT/E5, etc.).*

## Matching & Ranking:

*Compute similarity scores (cosine similarity/inner product) to rank resume-job pairs.*

## Evaluation:

*Assess performance using metrics like nDCG, MAP, F1, Precision, and Recall.*

## Deployment:

*Build a Streamlit (or Flask) web interface for resume upload, job listing, and real-time matching results.*
